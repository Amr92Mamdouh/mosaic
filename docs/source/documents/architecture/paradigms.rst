Stepping Paradigms
==================

MOSAIC supports multiple stepping paradigms for different types of
multi-agent interactions.

SteppingParadigm Enum
---------------------

.. code-block:: python

   from enum import Enum, auto

   class SteppingParadigm(Enum):
       SINGLE_AGENT = auto()    # Gymnasium
       SEQUENTIAL = auto()       # PettingZoo AEC
       SIMULTANEOUS = auto()     # PettingZoo Parallel / RLlib

SINGLE_AGENT
------------

Standard `Gymnasium <https://gymnasium.farama.org/>`_ interface with one agent.
One observation, one action, one reward per step.

   The standard agent-environment loop.

.. code-block:: python

   import gymnasium as gym

   env = gym.make("CartPole-v1")
   obs, info = env.reset()

   for _ in range(1000):
       action = policy(obs)
       obs, reward, terminated, truncated, info = env.step(action)

**Use cases**: CartPole, Atari, MuJoCo continuous control

SEQUENTIAL (AEC)
----------------

Agents take turns one at a time, following
`PettingZoo's AEC (Agent Environment Cycle) API <https://pettingzoo.farama.org/api/aec/>`_.
Each agent observes and acts before the next agent is called.

   The AEC cycle: agents act sequentially.

.. code-block:: python

   from pettingzoo.classic import chess_v6

   env = chess_v6.env()
   env.reset()

   for agent in env.agent_iter():
       obs, reward, termination, truncation, info = env.last()
       action = policy(agent, obs) if not termination else None
       env.step(action)

**Use cases**: Chess, Go, turn-based games, OpenSpiel

SIMULTANEOUS (POSG)
-------------------

All agents act at the same time, following
`PettingZoo's Parallel API <https://pettingzoo.farama.org/api/parallel/>`_.
This corresponds to a
`Partially Observable Stochastic Game (POSG) <https://www.marl-book.com/>`_:
each agent receives only a local observation of the shared state and submits
its action without seeing what other agents will do. The environment resolves
all actions together in one transition.

   All agents submit actions in the same step; the environment advances once
   all are collected.

.. code-block:: python

   from pettingzoo.butterfly import pistonball_v6

   env = pistonball_v6.parallel_env()
   observations, infos = env.reset()

   while env.agents:
       actions = {agent: policy(obs) for agent, obs in observations.items()}
       observations, rewards, terminations, truncations, infos = env.step(actions)

**Use cases**: MPE, cooperative control, competitive games, SocialJax social dilemmas, MeltingPot

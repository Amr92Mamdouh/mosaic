     <strong>LLM vs LLM Chess:</strong> Two LLM agents playing PettingZoo Chess (chess_v6) through MOSAIC's Operator system.
   </p>

Turn-based board games using PettingZoo's AEC (Alternating Environment Cycle) API.
In MOSAIC, these run with ``SEQUENTIAL`` stepping — each agent observes, decides,
and acts before the turn passes to the next player.

:Paradigm: Multi-agent (turn-based)
:Stepping: ``SEQUENTIAL``

Installation
------------

.. code-block:: bash

   pip install -e ".[pettingzoo]"

Standard chess with two players.  MOSAIC provides a built-in Stockfish opponent
so you can play Human vs AI or pit RL agents against the engine.

- **ID**: ``chess_v6``
- **Players**: 2
- **Action space**: Discrete (legal moves)
- **Observation**: 8×8×111 binary planes

.. note::

   Requires the Stockfish binary: ``sudo apt install stockfish`` (Linux)
   or ``brew install stockfish`` (macOS).

The ancient board game of Go.  Supports 9×9, 13×13, and 19×19 board sizes.

- **ID**: ``go_v5``
- **Players**: 2
- **Action space**: Discrete (board_size² + 1 for pass)
- **Observation**: board_size × board_size × 17 planes

Classic 4-in-a-row game on a 6×7 board.  A simple environment often used for
testing multi-agent algorithms.

- **ID**: ``connect_four_v3``
- **Players**: 2
- **Action space**: Discrete(7) — column selection
- **Observation**: 6×7×2 binary planes

   :width: 200px
   :align: right

3×3 Tic-Tac-Toe.  The simplest PettingZoo Classic environment — ideal for
testing MOSAIC's sequential stepping pipeline.

- **ID**: ``tictactoe_v3``
- **Players**: 2
- **Action space**: Discrete(9) — cell selection
- **Observation**: 3×3×2 binary planes

.. tip::

   In MOSAIC, you can assign **different agent types** to each player.
   For example, ``player_0`` as Human keyboard control and ``player_1``
   as a CleanRL-trained PPO agent:

   .. code-block:: python

      policy_service.bind_agent_policy("player_0", "human_keyboard")
      policy_service.bind_agent_policy("player_1", "cleanrl_ppo")
